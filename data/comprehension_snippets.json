    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "title": "The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "title": "The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "title": "The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

    "title": "The Perfect Pop Star for a Dumb Stunt",
    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "You\u2019d be forgiven for forgetting it now, but when Perry became famous, almost two decades ago, she was not such an oddity. Pop music was\u2014there\u2019s no other way to put it\u2014dumber back then, and so were its stars. But the world got more sophisticated. At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

    "source": "https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/04/katy-perry-space-celebrity/682476/?utm_source=feed",
    "snippet": "Katy Perry climbed aboard Jeff Bezos\u2019s Blue Origin rocketship with a smile on her face. She held a daisy, in tribute to her daughter, Daisy. She wore a skintight cobalt spacesuit custom-made by the designer Monse; the look had prompted her to say she and her mission-mates\u2014an all-female crew that also included an accomplished aerospace engineer and a onetime nominee for the Nobel Peace Prize\u2014\u201cwere putting the ass in astronaut!\u201d And then she traveled to the edge of space, where she gazed down at the blue marble before her and did the thing she\u2019s been doing since she was a child at her parents\u2019 Pentecostal church: She sang from her heart, about the bounty before her eyes. To paraphrase: She thought to herself / what a wonderful world. She was in the air for 10 minutes and 21 seconds total, and when she landed back on Earth, she kissed the ground like she\u2019d been lost at sea for months. Afterward, when a reporter asked her how she felt about being \u201cofficially an astronaut,\u201d Perry said that the experience showed her \u201chow much love you have to give and how loved you are.\u201d People have been finding this extremely funny. They\u2019ve been mocking her for not being up there long enough, and for being too solemn about the experience, and for reportedly studying string theory to prepare for it. \u201cWhat an incredibly dumb woman,\u201d someone wrote on X. \u201cAs a woman I\u2019m annoyed. As an engineer I\u2019m disgusted.\u201d The fast-food company Wendy\u2019s, of all entities, asked, \u201cCan we send her back\u201d? The critics have a point. I\u2019ve spent longer waiting for the subway than Perry was up in space. String theory is probably not a necessary prerequisite for sitting in a chair for a few minutes. Space tourism is, at best, folly\u2014silly, spectacularly wasteful, pointless by definition. (At worst, it\u2019s a remarkable way to get blown up.) But then again, so is celebrity. And Perry is a special kind of celebrity\u2014the sort who doesn\u2019t seem to mind looking kind of stupid. Beyonc\u00e9 likely wouldn\u2019t go to space. Taylor Swift probably wouldn\u2019t either. Going to space for no reason\u2014courtesy of a rich guy whom a lot of people don\u2019t like\u2014is risky in the physical sense, as well as in the sense that it\u2019s an invitation to get made fun of online. And those two women are serious, careful people. They\u2019re disciplined. They are always in control. Swift\u2019s Eras Tour was a meticulously constructed monument to the singer-songwriter\u2019s mythology\u2014a spectacle, sure, but one less of pop loopiness than of precision logistics. In Perry\u2019s Las Vegas residency, Play, by contrast, she sat perched next to a 16-foot-tall toilet and had a conversation with a giant turd. If Eras was a novel, Play was a knock-knock joke. It was a psychedelically moronic piece of performance art, and possibly the most fun I\u2019ve ever had seeing live music.",

At some point, we started demanding to know whom celebrities voted for. The new crop of teenage and 20-something female pop stars\u2014Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter, Billie Eilish, Olivia Rodrigo\u2014are weirder, angrier, and sharper than their predecessors, marinated as they have been in social media and post-Obama-era malaise. Compared with Perry and her ilk, they are less explicitly pandering to men but seem to care a lot about what their fans think of them. Even the ones, such as Carpenter, who go for over-the-top sexuality do it with a wink and a heteropessimist edge. And as Perry\u2019s contemporaries have entered their 30s and 40s, they\u2019ve matured. Beyonc\u00e9 might, once, have dressed like a cartoon character and declared herself \u201cbootylicious,\u201d but she grew up. Perry never did: She started out singing songs about being hot and happy, and never stopped. Her most recent album, 143, is a bouncy, brain-dead paean to pleasure and uncomplicated empowerment. Its lead single, \u201cWoman\u2019s World,\u201d has lyrics like an ad for panty liners and a beat like the preset on a child\u2019s electric keyboard. When it came out last summer, its girlboss-feminist message and male-gazey video felt like something that could have been buried, time-capsule-style, before Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency. (Its sexual politics too: I\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention that Perry recorded the album with Dr. Luke, the disgraced superproducer whom other artists have spoken out against.) In every way, Perry felt like an artifact. That\u2019s Perry, though: Always misreading the room. She is, in a word, cringe. For Millennials, especially, she\u2019s a reminder of just how embarrassing we all used to be: earnest, straightforward, unencumbered by irony or internet nihilism. With her, what you see is what you get. She\u2019s a performer. She\u2019s an old-fashioned celebrity in the sense that she is basically a clown. But in a moment when so much of fame feels, to me at least, calculated, cerebral, and coolly focus-grouped, Perry is singular. The Perry who happily hopped aboard a billionaire\u2019s galactic pleasure craft is the Perry who\u2019s friends with the toilet, is the Perry who sings about feeling like a plastic bag and living in a woman\u2019s world, is the Perry who showed up to the Met Gala dressed like a hamburger. She\u2019s guileless and goofy, sincere and allergic to subtlety, full of love. What a way to live.",

Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign.

I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump.

Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian.

I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign.

I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. In December, Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker asked Donald Trump about his threats of revenge during the campaign. He demurred. \u201cI\u2019m not looking to go back into the past. I\u2019m looking to make our country successful,\u201d he said. \u201cRetribution will be through success.\u201d During the first two months of his presidency, the prevailing theme of Trump\u2019s White House was the Elon Musk\u2013led attempt to drastically cut federal agencies. The purge is incomplete\u2014the U.S. DOGE Service continues to seek cuts at more agencies, and litigation has slowed or blocked some of the cuts\u2014but we seem to have already moved into the next stage: revenge. Trump took one of his most chilling steps toward retribution last week, when he directed the government to investigate two officials in his first administration: Chris Krebs, who headed the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Miles Taylor, who was chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security. The reasons Trump is out to get these two men are clear enough. Krebs, whose work focused on election security, was fired for refusing to say that fraud tainted the 2020 presidential election; as I wrote back in November of that year, Trump targeted him \u201cnot because he did a bad job, but because he did too good a job and said so.\u201d Taylor wrote a notable anonymous New York Times op-ed about administration officials resisting Trump, then published a book unmasking himself and worked to organize Republican opposition to Trump. One might be tempted to think that Trump\u2019s new orders rely on pretexts to target the duo, but they don\u2019t even really bother: They\u2019re pretty straightforward about the reasons. Trump is starting with a conclusion that the two men did something wrong and demanding the government work backwards to find some evidence to support it. The Krebs order is particularly Orwellian. As he uses the power of the federal government to try to punish someone for voicing his opinion, Trump alleges that Krebs\u2019s conduct \u201cboth violates the First Amendment and erodes trust in Government, thus undermining the strength of our democracy itself.\u201d You don\u2019t have to be a fan of either Krebs or Taylor to be alarmed by these actions, just as you don\u2019t have to agree with Mahmoud Khalil\u2019s views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict to see why his detention is a danger to all Americans. I criticized Taylor\u2019s anonymous op-ed as self-serving and short-sighted when it was published in 2018, but I don\u2019t believe that conduct I think is dumb or misguided is inherently criminal\u2014nor is conduct criminal solely because Trump doesn\u2019t like it.",

    "snippet": "Any legal inquiries into Krebs and Taylor seem unlikely to go anywhere, beyond stripping their security clearance, which Trump has the power to do. But the two will have to hire lawyers, likely at significant cost, and go through the stress and fear of defending themselves. Even if they triumph, they will have been made examples; other would-be dissenters will see their travails and think twice before speaking, as Trump intends. Trump has been quietly imposing retribution for some time, but the DOGE-led purges mean fewer longtime professionals who might object to or stand in the way of the latest revenge moves. Late last month, the White House stepped in to fire two career attorneys at the Justice Department \u201con behalf of President Donald J. Trump\u201d\u2014a serious break with the tradition of Justice Department semi-independence. In January, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, fired several attorneys who had prosecuted cases related to the January 6, 2021, riots. Trump also stripped security details for officials who had served in his first administration but later criticized him\u2014even though some face credible death threats from Iran because of actions they took on Trump\u2019s behalf. Meanwhile, in a sort of inverse retribution, the administration is rewarding its loyal allies. The Justice Department is pushing for the release of a man convicted of lying to FBI agents about the Biden family. (The original prosecutor on that case, by the way, was appointed U.S. Attorney by Trump.) DOJ is also arguing that people convicted of January 6 attacks on the Capitol whose cases were actively being appealed when Trump pardoned them should be refunded money that they paid in restitution. One prominent target for Trump\u2019s retribution has been law firms. Trump has gone after a series of major firms simply because current or former attorneys there were involved in things Trump hated: his felony conviction in Manhattan, Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, Special Counsel Jack Smith\u2019s work. Last week, he also assailed a firm that has represented plaintiffs in defamation cases related to 2020 election fraud. As the Atlantic contributor Paul Rosenzweig writes, the speed with which some of these firms have surrendered is deplorable. In the settlements, these firms have agreed to provide a combined total of about $1 billion in \u201cpro bono\u201d work supporting causes the president backs. As The Wall Street Journal reports, these deals have been negotiated by Trump\u2019s personal lawyer Boris Epshteyn, who is not a government employee\u2014making clear that these causes relate to Trump\u2019s personal revenge rather than some legitimate governmental purpose. But then, Trump has never seen much distinction between his own interests and the power of the government. For him, revenge isn\u2019t just a welcome adjunct to controlling the levels of government. It\u2019s the reason to control them.",

    "snippet": "Today The Atlantic is announcing three new staff members: Tyler Austin Harper, who was previously a contributing writer, will become a staff writer, and Jenna Johnson and Dan Zak will both be senior editors. Tyler has written for The Atlantic since 2023; before joining the magazine on staff, he was an associate professor at Bates College. Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category. I'm very happy to report to you that Jenna Johnson is joining The Atlantic as a senior editor. Jenna is a supremely talented journalist with deep expertise in all things Trump. She comes to us after 18 years at The Washington Post, where she most recently served as immigration editor. Before that role, she served as the deputy editor for democracy coverage. Jenna is beloved by her reporters, who tell us she guided them to the best work of their careers. She\u2019s creative, bold, and unfailingly prepared for whatever the news may bring. She also leads with empathy and is generous with advice for the dozens of young journalists she has mentored over the course of her career. Before becoming an editor, Jenna was best known for her distinctive coverage of Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. She was The Post\u2019s lead reporter on his 2016 presidential campaign and, through interviews with his supporters, produced memorable dispatches from rallies across the country. Jenna examined the types of communities where Trump held his events and documented how he made suspicion of Muslims, immigrants and other groups a centerpiece of his pitch to voters. As a White House reporter during his first administration, she documented America\u2019s deepening divisions.",

    "snippet": "Today The Atlantic is announcing three new staff members: Tyler Austin Harper, who was previously a contributing writer, will become a staff writer, and Jenna Johnson and Dan Zak will both be senior editors. Tyler has written for The Atlantic since 2023; before joining the magazine on staff, he was an associate professor at Bates College. Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category. I'm very happy to report to you that Jenna Johnson is joining The Atlantic as a senior editor. Jenna is a supremely talented journalist with deep expertise in all things Trump. She comes to us after 18 years at The Washington Post, where she most recently served as immigration editor. Before that role, she served as the deputy editor for democracy coverage. Jenna is beloved by her reporters, who tell us she guided them to the best work of their careers. She\u2019s creative, bold, and unfailingly prepared for whatever the news may bring. She also leads with empathy and is generous with advice for the dozens of young journalists she has mentored over the course of her career. Before becoming an editor, Jenna was best known for her distinctive coverage of Donald Trump and his MAGA movement. She was The Post\u2019s lead reporter on his 2016 presidential campaign and, through interviews with his supporters, produced memorable dispatches from rallies across the country. Jenna examined the types of communities where Trump held his events and documented how he made suspicion of Muslims, immigrants and other groups a centerpiece of his pitch to voters.

    "snippet": "Today The Atlantic is announcing three new staff members: Tyler Austin Harper, who was previously a contributing writer, will become a staff writer, and Jenna Johnson and Dan Zak will both be senior editors. Tyler has written for The Atlantic since 2023; before joining the magazine on staff, he was an associate professor at Bates College. Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category. I'm very happy to report to you that Jenna Johnson is joining The Atlantic as a senior editor. Jenna is a supremely talented journalist with deep expertise in all things Trump. She comes to us after 18 years at The Washington Post, where she most recently served as immigration editor. Before that role, she served as the deputy editor for democracy coverage. Jenna is beloved by her reporters, who tell us she guided them to the best work of their careers. She\u2019s creative, bold, and unfailingly prepared for whatever the news may bring.

Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category.

Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category.

Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023.

Jenna and Dan both come to The Atlantic from The Washington Post, where they have worked for almost two decades. Below is the announcement about these hires from The Atlantic\u2019s editor in chief, Jeffrey Goldberg: First, Tyler. As a contributing writer for us, he has published an impressive number of articles on an even more impressive range of topics: extreme fishing off Montauk, gun ownership in America, ChatGPT on college campuses, and many, many others. I speak for so many of us when I say that the more Tyler we have, the better. He\u2019ll be joining us from Bates College, where he has been an assistant professor of environmental studies. Now, Dan. Dan Zak is a gifted journalist with a talent for teasing out clear, compelling narratives, and for bringing complicated profiles to life. He brings to us a deep love for magazines and the craft of writing. (Don\u2019t get him started on the Caitlin Flanagan lede. Or, actually, do.) At The Post, he wrote for the Style section for nearly twenty years before becoming an editor in 2023. Dan is also the author of Almighty, a book about anti-nuclear activists, and he was nominated for a National Magazine Award this year in the feature writing category.
